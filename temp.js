        'Firms hail forex auction system\nby Staff reporter\n1 hr ago |\nViews\nZIMBABWE\'S biggest companies have hailed central bank governor, John Mangudya\'s foreign currency auction system for defusing a forex crisis that had affected production in the past year.\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) boss turned to the foreign currency auction system in June after seeing exchange rates rampage on the dominant parallel market where companies were accessing cash for raw materials and other imports.\nBy the first quarter of this year, the domestic currency had surrendered substantial value against the United States dollar, plummeting to about US$1: ZW$165 on the parallel market, from US$1: ZW$2,50 when it was introduced last June.\nBut since the return of the foreign currency auction system that faced heavy criticism by experts who said it had failed in 2004, the exchange rate has stabilised at about US$1: ZW$81.\nThis has also stabilised the parallel market rage, which almost grounded the economy by pushing up inflationary pressures and sparking relentless price hikes.\nThis week, the US dollar was trading at US$1:ZW$120 on the black market, where it has remained for five consecutive months.\nExperts are cautious about the sustainability of the current stability.\nBut in trading updates for the third quarter, big companies have said the central bank chief has saved the economy.\n"The trading environment in the last quarter ended September 30, 2020 was largely stable supported by the foreign currency exchange auction system and a contractionary fiscal policy," the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE)-listed Masimba Construction said.\nIt said its rebuilding efforts in Cyclone Idai-ravaged Eastern Highlands districts had been bolstered by the system.\n"Foreign exchange shortages were alleviated to a large extent, by the introduction of the foreign exchange auction system where the o',

CNBC reported that top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said on Thursday that Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has agreed to resume COVID-19 relief talks as cases surge across the country.     The report led to a bounce in stocks, pushed the euro to a session high versus the dollar, and pared losses in currencies that benefit from higher risk appetite such as the Australian dollar and the Norwegian crown.     Prior to the Nov. 3 U.S. election, financial markets had been riveted by the back-and-forth from lawmakers during the stimulus talks. In the end though, investors were resigned to the fact that any stimulus plan would be passed after President-elect Joe Biden takes office in January.     "The euro bottomed out against the dollar hours ago and technically when we got above $1.1850, the move higher accelerated," said Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Forex.     "I think the market is relatively thin and when the Schumer news hit, it further opened the door. The market is still sensitive to news about the stimulus," he added.     In late afterno',

Notes up 3 at 13809 up 16 for the week and the 5 Yr. up 2 at 12507 down 4 for the week. Yields are down for the week with the 2 Yr. down 1 basis point at 0.17%, the 5 yr. brown 4 at 0.39%, the 10 Yr. down 8 at 0.85% and the 30Yr Bond down 13 at 1.58%. Bonds topped out the week yesterday at 17315 the breaking to 17220 before rallying to present prices after the announcement of the closing of New York City schools Trumping the news of the Moderna virus vaccine. I feel that ultimately the vaccine will win out and the economy will grow slowly through 2nd quarter 2021 and heat up after that. This should push the 10 year yield over 1.00%.\nGrains: December Corn is down 56 at 4200 up64 for the week, January Beans down122 overnight at 11634 up 170 for the week and Wheat down 26 at 5954 down 40 for the week. Harvest being just about finished good export demand and good growing conditions in S. America resulted in a volatile week which saw Beans make a high of 11892 before breaking to current levels. I remain friendly to grains and feel we will see new highs as the market gains some upside momentum as Commodity Funds increase already near historic record long positions.\nCattle: Yesterday December Live Cattle closed67 lower at 110.65 down175 for the week and March Feeder Cattle down 227 at 136.90 down 470 for the week. Technically the market formed resistance at 111.80 in LCZ and 140.00 in FCH. On the downside I expect the gap in March Feeders from 135.57-136.22 made November 9th to be filled with the possible break to the 132.50-133.50. Levels. I will be a seller on rallies. Cattle on Feed report tomorrow.\nSilver: December Silver is 39 cent lower at 24.05 and 21 cents lower for the week after seeing prices form resistance above 25.00 earlier in the week",
